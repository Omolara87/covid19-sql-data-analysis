# 🦠 COVID-19 SQL Data Analysis

This portfolio project explores a COVID-19 case dataset using SQL for data cleaning, validation, trend analysis, and reporting. It demonstrates end-to-end data analytics workflow using only SQL.

---

## 📂 What's Included

- **`covid19.sql`** — single file containing:
  - NULL and type checking  
  - Temporal span and month-level summaries  
  - Monthly averages of confirmed cases, deaths, recovered  
  - Reporting queries (e.g. top regions by confirmed cases)  

---

## 🎯 How to Use This Repo

1. Load your COVID-19 dataset into a SQL-compatible database (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
2. Run the queries in `covid19.sql` in order.  
3. Use the results for charting, dashboards, or further data exploration (Power BI, Excel, Python, etc.).  

---

## ✨ Suggestions for Next Steps

- Split queries into separate files (`data_cleaning.sql`, `validation.sql`, `analysis.sql`, `reporting.sql`) to make navigation easier.  
- Add sample result screenshots to `docs/screenshots/` or save query outputs in `data/`.  
- Integrate a data visualization tool (Power BI, Tableau, Python notebooks) based on query results for storytelling or dashboards.
